# Real-Time Voice recognising
This repository demonstrates how a voice recognition app can be created using Streamlit. The code for this demo is based on the repository for Real-Time-Voice-Cloning.

This app allows you to:

Record your voice
Visualize the embedding of the speaker
Synthesize speech based on the recorded voice
